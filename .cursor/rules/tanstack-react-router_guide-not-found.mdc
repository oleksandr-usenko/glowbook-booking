# Not Found Errors

> ⚠️ This page covers the newer `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` API for handling not found errors. The `NotFoundRoute` route is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. See [Migrating from `NotFoundRoute`](#migrating-from-notfoundroute) for more information.

## Overview

There are 2 uses for not-found errors in TanStack Router:

- **Non-matching route paths**: When a path does not match any known route matching pattern **OR** when it partially matches a route, but with extra path segments
  - The **router** will automatically throw a not-found error when a path does not match any known route matching pattern
  - If the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `fuzzy`, the nearest parent route with a `notFoundComponent` will handle the error. If the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `root`, the root route will handle the error.
  - Examples:
    - Attempting to access `/users` when there is no `/users` route
    - Attempting to access `/posts/1/edit` when the route tree only handles `/posts/$postId`
- **Missing resources**: When a resource cannot be found, such as a post with a given ID or any asynchronous data that is not available or does not exist
  - **You, the developer** must throw a not-found error when a resource cannot be found. This can be done in the `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions using the `notFound` utility.
  - Will be handled by the nearest parent route with a `notFoundComponent` (when `notFound` is called within `loader`) or the root route.
  - Examples:
    - Attempting to access `/posts/1` when the post with ID 1 does not exist
    - Attempting to access `/docs/path/to/document` when the document does not exist

Under the hood, both of these cases are implemented using the same `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` API.

## The `notFoundMode` option

When TanStack Router encounters a **pathname** that doesn't match any known route pattern **OR** partially matches a route pattern but with extra trailing pathname segments, it will automatically throw a not-found error.

Depending on the `notFoundMode` option, the router will handle these automatic errors differently::

- ["fuzzy" mode](#notfoundmode-fuzzy) (default): The router will intelligently find the closest matching suitable route and display the `notFoundComponent`.
- ["root" mode](#notfoundmode-root): All not-found errors will be handled by the root route's `notFoundComponent`, regardless of the nearest matching route.

### `notFoundMode: 'fuzzy'`

By default, the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `fuzzy`, which indicates that if a pathname doesn't match any known route, the router will attempt to use the closest matching route with children/(an outlet) and a configured not found component.

> **❓ Why is this the default?** Fuzzy matching to preserve as much parent layout as possible for the user gives them more context to navigate to a useful location based on where they thought they would arrive.

The nearest suitable route is found using the following criteria:

- The route must have children and therefore an `Outlet` to render the `notFoundComponent`
- The route must have a `notFoundComponent` configured or the router must have a `defaultNotFoundComponent` configured

For example, consider the following route tree:

- `__root__` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
  - `posts` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
    - `$postId` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)

If provided the path of `/posts/1/edit`, the following component structure will be rendered:

- `<Root>`
  - `<Posts>`
    - `<Posts.notFoundComponent>`

The `notFoundComponent` of the `posts` route will be rendered because it is the **nearest suitable parent route with children (and therefore an outlet) and a `notFoundComponent` configured**.

### `notFoundMode: 'root'`

When `notFoundMode` is set to `root`, all not-found errors will be handled by the root route's `notFoundComponent` instead of bubbling up from the nearest fuzzy-matched route.

For example, consider the following route tree:

- `__root__` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
  - `posts` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
    - `$postId` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)

If provided the path of `/posts/1/edit`, the following component structure will be rendered:

- `<Root>`
  - `<Root.notFoundComponent>`

The `notFoundComponent` of the `__root__` route will be rendered because the `notFoundMode` is set to `root`.

## Configuring a route's `notFoundComponent`

To handle both types of not-found errors, you can attach a `notFoundComponent` to a route. This component will be rendered when a not-found error is thrown.

For example, configuring a `notFoundComponent` for a `/settings` route to handle non-existing settings pages:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/settings")({
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Settings page</p>
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    );
  },
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>This setting page doesn't exist!</p>;
  },
});
```

Or configuring a `notFoundComponent` for a `/posts/$postId` route to handle posts that don't exist:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) throw notFound();
    return { post };
  },
  component: ({ post }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        <p>{post.body}</p>
      </div>
    );
  },
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Post not found!</p>;
  },
});
```

## Default Router-Wide Not Found Handling

You may want to provide a default not-found component for every route in your app with child routes.

> Why only routes with children? **Leaf-node routes (routes without children) will never render an `Outlet` and therefore are not able to handle not-found errors.**

To do this, pass a `defaultNotFoundComponent` to the `createRouter` function:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  defaultNotFoundComponent: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Not found!</p>
        <Link to="/">Go home</Link>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## Throwing your own `notFound` errors

You can manually throw not-found errors in loader methods and components using the `notFound` function. This is useful when you need to signal that a resource cannot be found.

The `notFound` function works in a similar fashion to the `redirect` function. To cause a not-found error, you can **throw a `notFound()`**.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    // Returns `null` if the post doesn't exist
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) {
      throw notFound();
      // Alternatively, you can make the notFound function throw:
      // notFound({ throw: true })
    }
    // Post is guaranteed to be defined here because we threw an error
    return { post };
  },
});
```

The not-found error above will be handled by the same route or nearest parent route that has either a `notFoundComponent` route option or the `defaultNotFoundComponent` router option configured.

If neither the route nor any suitable parent route is found to handle the error, the root route will handle it using TanStack Router's **extremely basic (and purposefully undesirable)** default not-found component that simply renders `<div>Not Found</div>`. It's highly recommended to either attach at least one `notFoundComponent` to the root route or configure a router-wide `defaultNotFoundComponent` to handle not-found errors.

## Specifying Which Routes Handle Not Found Errors

Sometimes you may want to trigger a not-found on a specific parent route and bypass the normal not-found component propagation. To do this, pass in a route id to the `route` option in the `notFound` function.

```tsx
// _pathlessLayout.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathlessLayout")({
  // This will render
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Not found (in _pathlessLayout)</p>;
  },
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is a pathless layout route!</p>
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    );
  },
});

// _pathlessLayout/route-a.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathless/route-a")({
  loader: async () => {
    // This will make LayoutRoute handle the not-found error
    throw notFound({ routeId: "/_pathlessLayout" });
    //                      ^^^^^^^^^ This will autocomplete from the registered router
  },
  // This WILL NOT render
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Not found (in _pathlessLayout/route-a)</p>;
  },
});
```

### Manually targeting the root route

You can also target the root route by passing the exported `rootRouteId` variable to the `notFound` function's `route` property:

```tsx
import { rootRouteId } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) throw notFound({ routeId: rootRouteId });
    return { post };
  },
});
```

### Throwing Not Found Errors in Components

You can also throw not-found errors in components. However, **it is recommended to throw not-found errors in loader methods instead of components in order to correctly type loader data and prevent flickering.**

TanStack Router exposes a `CatchNotFound` component similar to `CatchBoundary` that can be used to catch not-found errors in components and display UI accordingly.

### Data Loading Inside `notFoundComponent`

`notFoundComponent` is a special case when it comes to data loading. **`SomeRoute.useLoaderData` may not be defined depending on which route you are trying to access and where the not-found error gets thrown**. However, `Route.useParams`, `Route.useSearch`, `Route.useRouteContext`, etc. will return a defined value.

**If you need to pass incomplete loader data to `notFoundComponent`,** pass the data via the `data` option in the `notFound` function and validate it in `notFoundComponent`.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post)
      throw notFound({
        // Forward some data to the notFoundComponent
        // data: someIncompleteLoaderData
      });
    return { post };
  },
  // `data: unknown` is passed to the component via the `data` option when calling `notFound`
  notFoundComponent: ({ data }) => {
    // ❌ useLoaderData is not valid here: const { post } = Route.useLoaderData()

    // ✅:
    const { postId } = Route.useParams();
    const search = Route.useSearch();
    const context = Route.useRouteContext();

    return <p>Post with id {postId} not found!</p>;
  },
});
```

## Usage With SSR

See [SSR guide](../ssr.md) for more information.

## Migrating from `NotFoundRoute`

The `NotFoundRoute` API is deprecated in favor of `notFoundComponent`. The `NotFoundRoute` API will be removed in a future release.

**The `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` will not work when using `NotFoundRoute`.**

The main differences are:

- `NotFoundRoute` is a route that requires an `<Outlet>` on its parent route to render. `notFoundComponent` is a component that can be attached to any route.
- When using `NotFoundRoute`, you can't use layouts. `notFoundComponent` can be used with layouts.
- When using `notFoundComponent`, path matching is strict. This means that if you have a route at `/post/$postId`, a not-found error will be thrown if you try to access `/post/1/2/3`. With `NotFoundRoute`, `/post/1/2/3` would match the `NotFoundRoute` and only render it if there is an `<Outlet>`.

To migrate from `NotFoundRoute` to `notFoundComponent`, you'll just need to make a few changes:

```tsx
// router.tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen.'
- import { notFoundRoute } from './notFoundRoute'  // [!code --]

export const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
- notFoundRoute // [!code --]
})

// routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  // ...
+ notFoundComponent: () => {  // [!code ++]
+   return <p>Not found!</p>  // [!code ++]
+ } // [!code ++]
})
```

Important changes:

- A `notFoundComponent` is added to the root route for global not-found handling.
  - You can also add a `notFoundComponent` to any other route in your route tree to handle not-found errors for that specific route.
- The `notFoundComponent` does not support rendering an `<Outlet>`.

# Outlets

Nested routing means that routes can be nested within other routes, including the way they render. So how do we tell our routes where to render this nested content?

## The `Outlet` Component

The `Outlet` component is used to render the next potentially matching child route. `<Outlet />` doesn't take any props and can be rendered anywhere within a route's component tree. If there is no matching child route, `<Outlet />` will render `null`.

> [!TIP]
> If a route's `component` is left undefined, it will render an `<Outlet />` automatically.

A great example is configuring the root route of your application. Let's give our root route a component that renders a title, then an `<Outlet />` for our top-level routes to render.

```tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Outlet /> {/* This is where child routes will render */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Parallel Routes

We haven't covered this yet. Stay tuned!

# Path Params

Path params are used to match a single segment (the text until the next `/`) and provide its value back to you as a **named** variable. They are defined by using the `$` character prefix in the path, followed by the key variable to assign it to. The following are valid path param paths:

- `$postId`
- `$name`
- `$teamId`
- `about/$name`
- `team/$teamId`
- `blog/$postId`

Because path param routes only match to the next `/`, child routes can be created to continue expressing hierarchy:

Let's create a post route file that uses a path param to match the post ID:

- `posts.$postId.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    return fetchPost(params.postId);
  },
});
```

## Path Params can be used by child routes

Once a path param has been parsed, it is available to all child routes. This means that if we define a child route to our `postRoute`, we can use the `postId` variable from the URL in the child route's path!

## Path Params in Loaders

Path params are passed to the loader as a `params` object. The keys of this object are the names of the path params, and the values are the values that were parsed out of the actual URL path. For example, if we were to visit the `/blog/123` URL, the `params` object would be `{ postId: '123' }`:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    return fetchPost(params.postId);
  },
});
```

The `params` object is also passed to the `beforeLoad` option:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
    // do something with params.postId
  },
});
```

## Path Params in Components

If we add a component to our `postRoute`, we can access the `postId` variable from the URL by using the route's `useParams` hook:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  return <div>Post {postId}</div>;
}
```

> 🧠 Quick tip: If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `Route` configuration to get access to the typed `useParams()` hook.

## Path Params outside of Routes

You can also use the globally exported `useParams` hook to access any parsed path params from any component in your app. You'll need to pass the `strict: false` option to `useParams`, denoting that you want to access the params from an ambiguous location:

```tsx
function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = useParams({ strict: false });
  return <div>Post {postId}</div>;
}
```

## Navigating with Path Params

When navigating to a route with path params, TypeScript will require you to pass the params either as an object or as a function that returns an object of params.

Let's see what an object style looks like:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <Link to="/blog/$postId" params={{ postId: "123" }}>
      Post 123
    </Link>
  );
}
```

And here's what a function style looks like:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <Link to="/blog/$postId" params={(prev) => ({ ...prev, postId: "123" })}>
      Post 123
    </Link>
  );
}
```

Notice that the function style is useful when you need to persist params that are already in the URL for other routes. This is because the function style will receive the current params as an argument, allowing you to modify them as needed and return the final params object.

## Allowed Characters

By default, path params are escaped with `encodeURIComponent`. If you want to allow other valid URI characters (e.g. `@` or `+`), you can specify that in your [RouterOptions](../../api/router/RouterOptionsType.md#pathparamsallowedcharacters-property)

Example usage:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  ...
  pathParamsAllowedCharacters: ['@']
})
```

The following is the list of accepted allowed characters:
`;` `:` `@` `&` `=` `+` `$` `,`
