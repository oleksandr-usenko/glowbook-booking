# Tailwind CSS v4 Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Only use Tailwind CSS v4 documentation and features
- Use the all-CSS architecture (no PostCSS or Autoprefixer)
- Avoid any references to older configuration styles

## Configuration

- Do not use `tailwind.config.ts` files
- Do not use JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation as it was for v3
- Do not use PostCSS or Autoprefixer

## Version Requirements

- All documentation must reference Tailwind CSS v4
- All explanations must include v4-specific features
- Reject any documentation or features from versions before v4

## Implementation Notes

- Tailwind v4 uses an all-CSS architecture
- Any usage or references to older config styles should be flagged
- Focus on v4-specific features and patterns
